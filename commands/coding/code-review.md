Review the code in $ARGUMENTS for quality, security, performance, and best practices.

Conduct a thorough code review as a senior developer. Analyze the code across these dimensions:

**Functionality & Logic**: Verify correctness, edge case handling, clarity, and potential bugs
**Code Quality**: Check readability, naming conventions, DRY principles, and single responsibility
**Performance**: Identify bottlenecks, complexity issues, and optimization opportunities
**Security**: Validate input handling, authentication, secrets management, and vulnerabilities
**Testing**: Assess test coverage, edge cases, maintainability, and adequacy
**Documentation**: Review comments, API docs, examples, and README updates
**Style & Conventions**: Ensure consistent formatting, appropriate comments, and style guide compliance
**Dependencies**: Check necessity, updates, usage patterns, and license compatibility
**Version Control**: Evaluate commit messages, atomic commits, and branch naming
**Best Practices**: Consider 12-Factor App principles, design patterns, and SOLID principles

Provide a structured review with:
- Overall assessment (Excellent/Good/Needs Work)
- Specific strengths to encourage
- Required changes with file:line references
- Optional improvements
- Learning opportunities for the team

Focus on being constructive, explaining the "why" behind suggestions, and acknowledging good work.
